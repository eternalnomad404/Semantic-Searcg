We were founded in 2007 to be a catalyst for NGOs by supporting them in strengthening their capabilities. We support NGOs in their capacity building journey across 10 organisation development areas. \n\nAtma's flagship programme is the Atma Accelerator which provides short and long term (upto 3 years) customised 1:1 capacity building support to high potential NGOs. We have worked with 92 NGOs over the past 15 years as part of the 3 year programme. \n\nAtma also enters into partnerships under the Atma Lab in order to undertake innovative projects that build the ecosystem and capacity of NGOs more collaboratively. We currently run 4-5 different projects under the Atma Lab which also help NGOs build capability. \n\nLastly, we believe in the power of volunteering and run a volunteer programme which helps NGOs leverage resources, bring in talent for the sector and allow Atma to provide its 1:1 support more efficiently. \n\nWe are committed towards building bigger, better and stronger NGOs towards improved developmental outcomes for the society and sector.

      "Our mission is to build digital solutions using open source technology to drive strategic transformation, operational efficiency and scale expansion for social sector organizations.\nIn developing countries, NGOs often supplement government efforts to provide services and bridge inequality. Technology can be a key enabler of scale and sustainability for these NGOs. However, NGOs often find technology inaccessible: they lack the technical know-how, financial capabilities, and team resources to build or successfully leverage technology solutions at and for scale.\nBy cultivating a trusted, active and engaged community of professionals across nonprofits, software, data and design firms, and funders - and equipping them with scalable, affordable, open-source tools (Nonprofit Tech Stack), talent (Fractional CxO for technology/data), and data skills, we empower our nonprofits to use technology and data effectively to serve their end users better.",
